Here we are creating three tables, that are team, match and venue
Table 1 - Team table 
    Match id (Primary key)
    Team 1
    Captain 1
    Team 2
    Captain 2
Table 2- Venue table
    Match id (Primary key)
    Venue_match
    Date_of_match
Table 3 - Match table
    Match id (Primary Key)
    Toss_won
    Match_won

It consist of 3 tables with a common column name Match id and it is a primary key 
so it will not contain any repeted value, and with the help of match id and joins 
we can connect with all the table and we have seperated tables for every topic 
like in team table we have the name of team and captain.
